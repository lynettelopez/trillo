# Trillo

Trillo is a fictional travel website that allows you to book hotels, flights, cars, and tours. This front-end project focuses on a single page in the Trillo model, using only CSS and HTML to create an animated hotel overview page. Credit for the front-end design goes to Jonas Schmedtmann.
